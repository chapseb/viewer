Welcome to the Bach Viewer
==========================

A free advanced image viewer.

Requirements
------------

Bachview requires PHP >= 5.3 and some 3rd party project:
- Slim for the routing part,
- Analog for the logging part,
- Twig for the templating part.

Directories structure
---------------------

Under the main bachview directory, you'll find several directories and files:
bachview
    - *app*: main application source files
    - *bin*: binaries (strings extraction, unit tests, ...Â°
    - *vendor*: 3rd party libraries needeed
    - *web*: web files that should be available from the webserver (main routing, css, js, images and so on)
    - *build.xml*: Phing (ant equivalent) config file
    - *composer.json*: composer configuration file
    - *composer.lock*: composer versions file

Installation with composer
--------------------------

You'll have first to download composer:
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use it to install viewer's dependencies:
$ php composer.phar install

That last command will populate *vendor* directory with all third party
libraries, in their relevant version.

You finally have to get your web server write access on some directories:
- app/cache
- app/logs

This can be achieved running a command that should like the following,
assuming 'apache' is the user name your web server has been started with:
$ chown -R apache:apache app/logs app/cache

Configuration
-------------

Main configuration file is located under *app/config* directory, and is named
config.yml (YAML syntax, see http://yaml.org/).

If you want to change the configuration, please copy config.yml file to
local.config.yml, and edit this new one.

You are not required to copy all the file, just the parts that change, default
configuration will apply.
