Welcome to the Bach Viewer
==========================

A free advanced image viewer.

Requirements
------------

Bachview requires PHP >= 5.3.7 and some 3rd party project:
- Slim for the routing part,
- Analog for the logging part,
- Twig for the templating part.

Directories structure
---------------------

Under the main bachview directory, you'll find several directories and files:
bachview
    - *app*: main application source files
    - *vendor*: 3rd party libraries needeed
    - *web*: web files that should be available from the webserver (main routing, css, js, images and so on)
    - *composer.json*: composer configuration file, for convenience

Installation
------------

You'll have first to download composer:
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use it to install viewer's dependencies:
$ php composer.phar install

That last command will populate *vendor* directory with all third party
libraries, in their relevant version.

Configuration
-------------

Main configuration file is located under *app/config* directory, and is named
config.yml (YAML syntax, see http://yaml.org/).

Please be carefull editing this file, you would throw fatal errors if you remove
a required entry.
